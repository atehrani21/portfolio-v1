         <h4>Project Description</h4>
          <p>I implemented a web development initiative for my uncle’s CPA firm to better promote the key tax and accounting services he offers. The first step was to create a static version of the site, and then convert it to WordPress in order to make it dynamic. The static version was made using HTML, CSS, JQuery, and Bootstrap, which was essential in making the site responsive to all screen sizes. Once this was completed, PHP was utilized in order to convert the site to WordPress. By doing this, not only did I make the site dynamic, but I also implemented a setup that my client could edit without having to know how to code.</p>

          <p>His firm did not have a digital presence prior to my implementation, so it was important that the information was also shown on major search engines through SEO monitoring. By setting up weekly deadlines, I was able to break down the development process into deliverables and have each piece of the site, such as the slider, developed in parts rather than at once. Successful completion of the project required collaboration with business owner Mark Tehrani in order to consistently monitor the interface’s performance and debug any issues that arise.</p>
