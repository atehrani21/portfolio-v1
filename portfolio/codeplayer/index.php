         <h4>Project Description</h4>
          <p>Writing and running front-end code now made easier than ever. With TB CodePlayer, Today’s Business employees can write their own HTML and CSS into an online code editor, absolutely free. After designing the layout with basic HTML and CSS, I implemented various jQuery functions in order to create navigation tabs that responded to user clicks as well as run code right on the page without refreshing. By doing this, not only did I greatly improve the functionality of the site, but I also reduced the need for loading times. Simply by navigating through a menu, users can write their code and click to see their creation right there without any loading annoyances.</p>

          <p>In addition, I implemented PHP and MySQL in order to create a login system where the employees can create an account and start coding. This was done to ensure the site remains secure and prevent anyone outside of Today’s Business from accessing it. The purpose of the database did not end here, however. In addition to securely storing user information, the MySQL database also stored any content within the textareas for each coding section. This prevents the code from disappearing when a user refreshes the page, closes the window, or logs out. Even when they log back in, the code appears exactly as it was during the previous session.</p>
