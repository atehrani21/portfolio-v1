         <h4>Project Description</h4>
          <p>I conducted research into the effects of responsive web design on digital marketing, university, and freelance web developers. Particular attention was paid to how usability and search engine optimization are improved on a responsive website. To present my findings publicly, I developed a responsive template that displayed the procedures and evidence gathered throughout the 5 week project. This was done both for presentation and as a means for demonstrating responsive design in action.</p>
